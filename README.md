# ben-8
an emulator for the 8-bit cpu demonstrated on Ben Eaters youtube channel. <br>
most of the features are here, but there are still some things i need to add. <br>
there is no real reason i kept the "LEDs" for viewing the the register and ram values, i just liked the aesthetic

## purpose
the purpose for this project was just to learn how a CPU interacts with it's environment and turns opcodes into executable instructions. <br>
